## About
This is a dummy OAuth application (Provider).


## Getting up and running

This application is the OAuth Provider/Server application (on port 3000) and should be run alongside the Consumer/Client application (on port 3001).

The reason they are to be run on specific ports is due to the omniauth configuration on the Consumer application in doorkeeper.rb:

```
option :client_options, {
  site:          'http://localhost:3000',
  authorize_url: 'http://localhost:3000/oauth/authorize'
}
```


## OAuth Provider

The Provider application authenticates the user using the devise gem. It also carries out the authorization of Consumer applications by providing the user with an authorization_code that is then exchanged for an access_token (a JWT).

Once running, Consumer applications can be added on the http://localhost:3000/oauth/applications page.

```
git clone git@github.com:PMGH/oauth2-test-provider.git
```

- cd into repo and run: `PORT=3000 rails server`


## OAuth Consumer

The OAuth Consumer application is the app which the user is seeking access to.

```
git clone git@github.com:PMGH/oauth2-test-consumer.git
```

- cd into repo and run: `PORT=3001 rails server`


## Workflow (HTML)
- When trying to access the Consumer app (localhost:3001) for the first time the user should be redirected to the sign in page of the Provider app (localhost:3000/users/sign_in)
- Once signed in they should be presented with the Authorization request (at localhost:3000/oauth/authorize) with Authorize and Deny buttons. The url should contain the following query params:

- client_id - the Consumer app id found on the http://localhost:3000/oauth/applications/:id page
- redirect_uri - the Consumer app callback uri found on the http://localhost:3000/oauth/applications/:id page e.g. http://localhost:3001/auth/doorkeeper/callback
- response_code=code  - expects an authorization code to be returned

For example:

`http://localhost:3000/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&response_type=code`

- Once authorized the user will be provided an authentication code that the Provider app exchanges for an access_token.
- Redirect to the Consumer app that they initially tried to access.
- The Consumer app adds an access_token cookie that allows the user access for as long as the token is valid.
- Token expiry is determined by the Provider app (the issuer) in the doorkeeper.rb file.


## API Journey (JSON)

**Get an access_token** (using Postman)
- Create a new POST request
- Navigate to the Authorization tab
- Set 'Add authorization data to' to Request Headers
- Select the Get Access Token button
- Set the necessary Headers e.g.

```
Token Name:           Consumer Access Token
Grant Type:           Authorization code
Callback URL:         http://localhost:3001/auth/doorkeeper/callback
Auth URL:             http://localhost:3000/oauth/authorize
Access Token URL:     http://localhost:3000/oauth/token
Client ID:            7284d5786ad5f08a523916b992175210dc4dd1b6995e0028d5d856a31f077523
Client Secret:        dafa4a696ff4c4b6ddb9a0b6253414e2c05ee2b221e8fb6cbd5ba635abed5e45
Scope:                
State:                
Client Authentication:  Send client credentials in body
```

- Request Token

You can now include the returned access_token in subsequent requests to the Consumer application.\n
This can be done by setting the Authorization Type to Bearer Token for those requests and using 'Bearer [access_token]'.
